# genRSS

[![Build Status](https://github.com/amsehili/genRSS/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/amsehili/genRSS/actions/workflows/ci.yml/)


`genRSS` is a tool to create an RSS 2.0 feed from media files in a directory.
Files can be looked for recursively in subdirectories and can be restricted to a
given set of extensions.

## Installation

Another package named `genrss` already exists on pypi, we use `generss` (with an
*e* after the *n*) for installation:

    pip install generss

Once installed, you can use `genRSS` on the command line.

## Determining file duration

To include media file duration in your feeds (using the `<itunes:duration>` tag),
`genRSS` use tries the following options.

- `mutagen`: a python package installed alongside `genRSS` that can deal with
audio and video files.
- `sox`: can only handle audio files, runs faster than `ffprobe`.
- `ffprobe`: normally installed with `ffmpeg`, can deal with audio and video files
but it is the slowest of the three options.

In any case, if `genRSS` fails to get media file duration with one tool, it'll
fall back to the next one. If none of these tools is installed or if file duration
cannot be obtained, no `<itunes:duration>` tag will be inserted.


## Usage options

Type `genRSS -h` to show the usage options:

```

                        This directory name will be appended to the host name
                        to create absolute paths to your media files.
